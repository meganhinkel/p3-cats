Link to my deployed website: https://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/hinkelme/p3-cats/index.html

My website combines two APIs, the CatBreedDB and PetFinder, to provide users with a way to learn more about
different cat breeds and search for cats of that breed that are available for adoption nearby. There are two 
ways to do this, one being searching for a specific breed.

If you already have some knowledge on a breed and wish to learn more you can search for it (spelling must be correct
though). If the database contains that breed it will display many facts and an image (if available). Then a button
will appear that enables the user to enter their zip code and it will filter cats of that breed available
for adoption nearby. (The default zip code is 22801) If there are some available, their names are displayed in
a list and can be clicked on to go to their adoption page on PetFinder.

The other way to find adoptable cat breeds is through looking at the full list of breeds in the database and
selecting one to learn more about. Then the same button is displayed to prompt a zip code and search for available
cats.

My project satisfies the following requirements:
1) deploy site
My site is accessible to the public through w3.cs.jmu.edu and also on github.io.
2) is responsive
My site has varying presentation on mobile and on larger viewports. On larger viewpoints the navigation bar
spans across the top, while on smaller ones it turns into a drop down menu. The content of the page also 
wraps as the viewport is made smaller, so no text is ever cut off.
3) uses 2 different apis
Two APIs are used to accomplish my website's functionality- the CatBreedDB and PetFinder APIs.
4) has search
The user is able to search for a specific cat breed.
5) displays results
If there is an match in the database to the entered cat breed then all of the information about it is
displayed. The same goes for entering a zip code.
6) results are filterable
Users are able to filter the results by entering a zip code.
